## What is this project?
> When I bought my amateur radio early this year, I asked myself: Why should you have it, where can you use it, how do you use it?

Because it is cool. On my car in the future or at the home. I have no clear idea about it.

> In the mid-2015, I had my first car, a 2013 Tiguan, then I asked myself again: What do you want to do on your "girlfriend"?

Make fun on it. Make it more interesting, functional and joyful.

> How?

Make it like a Electrical warfare cruiser or a mobile workshop. Bingo!


## Why Heron?
Heron is a electronic warfare aircraft in the game EVE-Online. It can take a lot of ECM/ECCM equipments and has excellent buff on related effection. So I use Heron to name my car.

## Project Overview
Limited by budget, time and knowledge, this project consists of three stages. Now Im working on the stage 1.

1. Stage 1: Short-term goal
  * Power distribution
  * CAN over power line (Pre-research)
  * Central computer
  * Vehicle Radio
  * Wiring

2. Stage 2: Mid-term goal
  * Satellite chasing
  * Car status monitoring
  * Environmental sensors

3. Stage 3: Long-term goal
  * Augment reality
  * Live video


## First Stage
First stage is the most important fundamental part for this project. During this stage, I need to develop a powerful and reliable power system and physical structure.

By now I have installed a roof rack system and remove one rear seat. I plan to install all the antennas, cameras, Manipulators and guars on the roof, and install all the devices equipments include batteries on the rear seat room, then I dont need to occupy the rest of space.

### Back Seat

### Back seat space Solidworks

Current sketch of back seat space orginazation design on Solidworks. My back seat does not have enough width to install 19" EIA standard rack system, so I can only use customize sized rack system. Two batteries on the seat are vehicle standard 12V batteries. By calculation, two batteries can give ~140AH power at 12V. Also, Automatic Charging Relay, IMD and Fuse are neccessary. On the botton of seat is an extinguisher. On the rack, I plan to install a Beaglebone black computer, a WiFi router, UHF/VHF vehicle radio, and etc.

## Project management
I am the only developer in this project, and I need to sponsor myself. So I just use my spare time on this project, and the whole developing story will be very long as expected.
